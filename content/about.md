My name is James, I love to take photos of squirrels and other cute animals. I am passionate about Squirrels. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring my creative side through hobbies such as photography and travelling. 

PS, A side note I do not exist, and my photo was taken from "thispersondoesnotexist.com".

Oh and My password is somewhere on my github.
