Penetration testing with Damn Vulnerable Web Application: A Penetration Testing project was carried out on Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) that was set up on a virtual machine using VirtualBox. Kali Linux to exploit the vulnerabilities found in the web application. Vulnerabilities were identified by utilizing vulnerability scanners such as Skipfish and Nessus. The aim of the project is to improve security by identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.</description>
