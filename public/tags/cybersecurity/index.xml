      <description>The cyber world has changed a lot in the past decade. Almost everything has been moved to the cloud. The days of on premise data centers are gone. The amount of deploys a company makes has also increased drastically. Gone are the days of 2 to 3 deploys a year. Companies deploy their software 3 to 4 times a hour on average these days. With such drastic changes, one might think that the amount of threats have gone up, but that is not the case.</description>
